# PYWAVAN

## Wavelet transforms functions for python

The main function of this repository is **fan_trans()**, which can be found in *wavan.py*

The function **fan_trans()** performs the Fan wavelet transform as described by [Kirby 2005](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005CG.....31..846K).

Additional options allow the user to perform a Multiscale non-Gaussian segmentation as descirbed by [Robitaille et al. 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.2726R) and Robitaille et al. 2019 (in preparation).
